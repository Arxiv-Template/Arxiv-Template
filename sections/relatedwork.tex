Previous efforts to standardize document preparation for academic publishing have primarily focused on journal-specific templates or proprietary software solutions. For example, Elsevier and Springer provide LaTeX templates tailored to their respective journals, but these are not suitable for open-access platforms like arXiv. Similarly, tools such as Overleaf offer collaborative environments for writing LaTeX documents, yet they do not enforce uniformity or aesthetics.

Some community-driven initiatives have attempted to create general-purpose templates for arXiv. Notable examples include the arxiv-style package and custom templates shared via GitHub repositories. While these resources are valuable, they often lack comprehensive documentation, flexibility, or attention to visual design. Our work builds upon these foundations by incorporating best practices from both academia and graphic design, further enhanced by leveraging cutting-edge AI technologies provided by Qwen and DeepSeek.
