\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper presents a clean, unified, and aesthetically pleasing LaTeX template for arXiv submissions. By combining rigorous design principles with practical implementation details, our template simplifies the manuscript preparation process while improving the visual quality of published works. With significant contributions from AI models Qwen and DeepSeek, we were able to incorporate innovative features that enhance both functionality and user experience. Initial evaluations suggest that it meets the needs of a wide range of researchers, making it a valuable resource for the academic community.

We hope that this contribution will inspire further efforts toward standardizing and enhancing the presentation of scientific knowledge on platforms like arXiv.
