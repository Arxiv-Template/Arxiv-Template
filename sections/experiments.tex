\section{Experiments}

To evaluate the effectiveness of our template, we conducted two sets of experiments:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=7mm,itemsep=2mm, topsep=0em]
    \item[1.] Qualitative Assessment : A panel of ten researchers from various disciplines reviewed sample papers formatted with our template. They rated each document on readability, visual appeal, and overall satisfaction.
    \item[2.] User Feedback : We distributed the template to a group of 20 graduate students and early-career researchers, asking them to prepare mock submissions and provide feedback on usability and customization.
\end{itemize}

Results indicate that participants found the template intuitive and effective, with average satisfaction scores exceeding 85\%. Common praises included "professional appearance" and "ease of modification." Several users specifically noted how seamlessly the AI-generated components integrated into the template.
