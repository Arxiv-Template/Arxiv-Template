\subsection{Design Principles}

Our template is guided by three core design principles:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=7mm,itemsep=2mm, topsep=0em]
    \item Cleanliness : The layout avoids clutter and focuses on content readability.
    
    \item Unification : Consistent typography, spacing, and sectioning ensure that all papers using the template share a common identity.
    
    \item Aesthetic Appeal : Thoughtful use of whitespace, font choices, and color schemes enhances the visual impact without overwhelming the reader.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Design Principles}

The template is implemented in LaTeX, leveraging modern packages such as geometry, fontspec, and microtype to achieve precise control over page layout and typography. Key features include:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=7mm,itemsep=2mm, topsep=0em]
    \item Automatic generation of title pages and metadata.
    
    \item Support for multi-column layouts, figures, tables, and mathematical equations.
    
    \item Customizable options for author affiliations, abstract placement, and bibliographies.
\end{itemize}

Additionally, we provide detailed documentation and sample files to help users quickly adapt the template to their specific needs.

\textbf{Collaboration with Qwen and DeepSeek}

In developing this template, we collaborated extensively with two powerful AI models: Qwen~\footnote{\url{https://qwen.ai}} and DeepSeek~\footnote{\url{https://chat.deepseek.com}}. Their contributions included:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=7mm,itemsep=2mm, topsep=0em]
    \item[1.] Automated Code Generation : Both Qwen and DeepSeek assisted in generating efficient and error-free LaTeX code snippets, reducing manual coding time and ensuring high-quality implementation.
    
    \item[2.] Semantic Content Structuring : Using their advanced natural language understanding capabilities, Qwen and DeepSeek helped optimize the logical flow of sections and subsections, ensuring that the template adheres to best practices for academic writing.
    
    \item[3.] Layout Optimization : Through iterative refinement, Qwen and DeepSeek analyzed feedback from early testers to suggest improvements in whitespace usage, figure placement, and table formatting, resulting in a more polished final product.
\end{itemize}

These AI-driven enhancements allowed us to create a template that not only meets technical requirements but also offers a superior user experience.
