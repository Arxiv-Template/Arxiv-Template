\section{Introduction}

The dissemination of research findings is a critical component of academic progress, and arXiv plays an indispensable role in facilitating this process. Despite its widespread adoption, many authors struggle with formatting their manuscripts due to the absence of an official, universally accepted template. As a result, arXiv submissions vary significantly in style, structure, and visual appeal, which can detract from the clarity and professionalism of the work presented.

\emph{
Towards a Clean, Unified, and Aesthetically Pleasing arXiv Template
}
\end{center}

To address this issue, we propose a novel LaTeX-based template that prioritizes three key objectives: (1) cleanliness, ensuring minimal distractions caused by unnecessary design elements; (2) unification, promoting consistency across different papers; and (3) aesthetic appeal, enhancing the visual experience for readers. The development of this template was made possible through close collaboration with two state-of-the-art AI assistants, Qwen~\cite{hui2024qwen2} and DeepSeek~\cite{guo2025deepseek}, whose capabilities in natural language processing and code generation were instrumental in achieving our goals. By adhering to these principles, our template aims to streamline the submission process and improve the overall quality of published works on arXiv.
