\section{Discussions}

While our template addresses many challenges associated with arXiv submissions, several limitations remain. First, some advanced LaTeX users may prefer more granular control over formatting than our template currently offers. Second, although we aimed for broad compatibility, certain edge cases—such as highly specialized equation rendering—may require additional adjustments.

Future work could focus on expanding the template's feature set, integrating support for alternative markup languages (e.g., Markdown), and exploring machine learning techniques to automate parts of the formatting process. Continued collaboration with AI models like Qwen and DeepSeek will be crucial in realizing these advancements.
